Run insert.bat on any windows computer to get discord set up with your better discord
themes and plugins. If you would like to copy the configurations from an already
existing better discord installation, make sure your Themes and Plugins are in the
folders before running.

Running reset.bat will thoroughly clean the computer of files created by discord, and 
information about discord. Discord will not show up in the program list, the 
start menu, and the shortcut will be removed, along with the main discord files 
in AppData/Roaming and AppData/Local. This will also remove the better discord files 
in AppData/Roaming.
